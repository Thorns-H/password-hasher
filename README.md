# Password Hasher Utility
I make this software just as a simple project with GUI to hash any text.
#### MD5 Hash Usage
We use the **hashlib** python library, this program only encodes in a hexdigest format. So make sure to use this program only if you're using this exact format.

This is pretty straight forward but you can apply this type of hash to digital signatures, message authentication codes, manipulation detection, fingerprints, checksums or user's login data.
